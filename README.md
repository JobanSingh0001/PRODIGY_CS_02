# Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption üîê

This project is part of my cybersecurity internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**. The goal was to develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation techniques, providing a foundation for image-based data security. The encryption works by altering pixel values based on a key, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt images.

## Project Overview

This tool demonstrates basic image encryption using **Python** and **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**. The encryption process manipulates the RGB values of each pixel to transform the image into a secured format. It offers a simple but effective way to obscure visual data, which can only be recovered using the correct decryption key.

### Features
- Encrypts images by performing pixel manipulation and mathematical operations.
- Decrypts encrypted images back to their original form using the correct key.
- Supports PNG, JPG, and BMP image formats.
- Simple command-line interface for encrypting and decrypting images.
  
### Use Cases
- **Data Privacy**: Securely storing and sharing sensitive images.
- **Digital Watermarking**: Protecting intellectual property.
- **Basic Steganography**: A foundation for hiding data in images.

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library for image manipulation

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install pillow
```

### Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pixel-manipulation-encryption.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd pixel-manipulation-encryption
    ```

3. Make sure your images are placed in the **images** folder. Adjust the file path in the code if needed.

4. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python PixelManipulationForImageEncryption.py
    ```

### Usage

1. **Encrypt Image**:
   Provide the image path and an encryption key to encrypt the image.
   ```python
   # Example usage for encryption
   encrypted_image = encrypt_image('images/sample_image.png', 12345)
   encrypted_image.show()
   ```

2. **Decrypt Image**:
   Provide the encrypted image path and the decryption key.
   ```python
   # Example usage for decryption
   decrypted_image = decrypt_image('images/encrypted_image.png', 12345)
   decrypted_image.show()
   ```

### How It Works

- **Encryption**: The RGB values of the image pixels are altered by a simple mathematical operation (e.g., adding or subtracting a key value). The altered image is stored as the encrypted image.
- **Decryption**: The same mathematical operation is reversed using the provided key, recovering the original image.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more advanced encryption algorithms for stronger security.
- Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier usage.
- Implement support for larger image file types.
